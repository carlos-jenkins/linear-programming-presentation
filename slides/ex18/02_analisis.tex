\begin{frame}{Example 18 - Analisis}
The paper recylcing plant need to minimize the cost of meeting demands for pulp.
It is needed some raw material and some processes like de-inking and asphalt
dispersion, so to minimize the cost we have to sum the cost of the raw material
purchase + the cost of sending materials (inputs) through the diferent processes
(de-inking and asphalt dispersion)
