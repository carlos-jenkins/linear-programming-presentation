\begin{frame}{Example 16 - Problem (2)}
By law at most 100000 gallons of wine can be produced each year. A maximum of
12000 labor hours and 32000 tank hours are available annually. Each gallon of
wine 1 spends an average of (1/2) year in inventory; wine 2, an average of 1
year; wine 3, an average of 2 years; wine 4, an average of 3.333 years. The
winery's warehouse can handle an average inventory level of 50000 gallons.
Determine how much of each type of wine should be produced annually to maximize
OliverWinery's profit.
