\begin{frame}{Example 05 - Restrictions}

To what restrictions refers the first ones would be given by the fact that the
contaminants needs to be reduced by al least 30 tons for contaminant 1 and
at least 30 tons for contaminant 2. That is, we take the amount of contaminant
per ton for each factory and we multiply it with the variables:
$0.1 \colora{x} + 0.2 \colorb{y} + 0.4\colorc{z} \ge 30$; in the same way for
the contaminant 2 we have:
$0.45\colora{x} + 0.25\colorb{y} + 0.3\colorc{z} \ge 40$ At last we have a
trivial restrictions that $x, y, z$ must be greater or equal to 0 because
tons can't be negative.
