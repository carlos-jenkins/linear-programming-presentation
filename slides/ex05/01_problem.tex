\begin{frame}{Example 05 - Problem (1)}
There are three factories on the Momiss River (1, 2 and 3). Each emits two types
of pollutants (1 and 2) into the river. If the waste from each factory is
processed, the pollution in the river can be reduced. It costs \$15 to process a
ton of factory 1 waste, and each ton processed reduces the amount of pollutant 1
by 0.10 ton and the amount of pollutant 2 by 0.45 ton. It costs \$10 to process
a ton of factory 2 waste, and each ton processed will reduce the amount of
pollutant 1 by 0.20 ton and the amount of pollutant 2 by 0.25 ton. It costs \$20
to process a ton of factory 3 waste, and each ton processed will reduce the
amount of pollutant 1 by 0.40 ton and the amount of pollutant 2 by 0.30 ton.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Example 05 - Problem (2)}
The state wants to reduce the amount of pollutant 1 in the river by at least 30
tons and the amount of pollutant 2 in the river by at least 40 tons. Formulate
an LP that will minimize the cost of reducing pollution by the desired amounts.
