\begin{frame}{Example 01 - Problem}
Farmer Jones must determine how many acres of corn and wheat to plant this year.
An acre of wheat yields 25 bushels of wheat and requires 10 hours of labor per
week. An acre of corn yields 10 bushels of corn and requires 4 hours of labor
per week. All wheat can be sold at \$4 a bushel, and all corn can be sold at
\$3 a bushel. Seven acres of land and 40 hours per week of labor are available.
Government regulations require that at least 30 bushels of corn be produced
during the current year.
