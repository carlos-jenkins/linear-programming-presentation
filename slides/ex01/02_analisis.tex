Each bushel of wheat can be sold at \$4 and each one of corn at \$3. Also it says
that for each acre of wheat  it will produce 25 bushels (The profit by acre of wheat will
be 25 bushels, at \$4 each bushel) and for each acre of corn it will be produced 10
bushels (The profit by acre of corn will be 10  bushels, at \$3 each bushel). With this
information we could stablish the function that refers to maximize the profits of planting
corn and wheat as:
\begin{align*}
    Z &= 100\colora{AT} + 30\colorb{AM}
\end{align*}
