\begin{frame}{Example 01 - Restrictions}

About the restrictions, the first one would be about the working hours;
1 acre of wheat requires 10 hours of labor per week and 1 acre of corn
requires 4 hours of labor per week; and there are 40 hours available, this
restricted us that the sum of 10AT and 4AM must less or equal than 40
(labour hours available). The second restriction refers to the availability
of land. There are 7 acres of land available so AT + AM must be less or equal
than 7. Also there is a restriction from Government which that at least
30 bushels of corn be produced during the current year, so AM must be
greater or equal that 3, because each acre produce 10 bushels so 3*10 = 30
that is the minimun required. Finally we have the trivial restrictions that all
variables must be greater or equal than 0.
