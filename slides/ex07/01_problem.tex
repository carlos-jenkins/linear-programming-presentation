\begin{frame}{Example 07 - Problem}
Highland's TV-Radio Store must determine how many TVs and radios to keep in
stock. A TV requires 10 sq ft of floorspace, whereas a radio requires 4 sq ft;
200 sq ft of floorspace is available. A TV will earn Highland \$60 in profits,
and a radio will earn \$20. The store stocks only TVs and radios. Marketing
requirements dictate that at least 60\% of all appliances in stock be radios.
Finally, a TV ties up \$200 in capital, and a radio, \$50. Highland wants to
have at most \$3000 worth of capital tied up at any time. Formulate an LP that
can be used to maximize Highland's profit.
