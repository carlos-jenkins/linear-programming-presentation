\begin{frame}{Example 07 - Restrictions}

The first restriction would be about the space available in the store and the
space both TVs and radios requires. There is 200ft\superscript{2} available and
a TV requires 10ft\superscript{2} and a radio requires 4ft\superscript{2}; from
there we have the restriction $10\colora{TV} + 4\colorb{R} \le 200$. Another
restriction is about the requires that from marketing, which would give the
equation: $\frac{\colorb{R}}{\colora{TV} + \colorb{R}} \ge 0.6$. Futhermore,
the are presented by the fact that Highlands want to invest un maximum of \$3000
in capital and both TVs and radios requires \$200 and \$50 respectively; that
gives the restriction: $200\colora{TV} + 50\colorb{R} \le 3000$. Finally we
need not to forget the trivial restriction that both TVs and radios needs to be
positive as we can buy negative things.
