\begin{frame}{Example 10 - Restrictions}

This problem has many restrictions, so we will enumerate them accordingly to
their position in the next slide (model):

\begin{enumerate}
\item Restricts the amount of material that can be bought.
\item Restricts the amount of products that M can generate.
\item Another equation that restricts the amount of products that M can generate.
\item And yet another one.
\item Restricts the amount of type 1 products to create.
\item Restricts the amount of type 2 products to create.
\item Restricts the amount of type 5 products to create.
\item Restricts the amount of type 6 products to create.
\item The final and trivial restrictions.
\end{enumerate}
