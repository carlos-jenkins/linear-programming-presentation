\begin{frame}{Example 10 - Analisis}
A company produces six products in the following fashion. Each unit of raw material purchased yields four units of product 1,
two units of product 2, and one unit of product 3.  We need to maximize the profit so we need
to get the sum of (Production Costs - Unit Sale Price) * Product for each product produced,
minus the cost of destroying product 5 and product 6 and the cost of raw material.
