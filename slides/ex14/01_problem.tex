\begin{frame}{Example 14 - Problem}
Steelco manufactures two types of steel at three different steel mills. During
a given month, each steel mill has 200 hours of blast furnace time available.
Because of differences in the furnaces at each mill, the time and cost to
produce a ton of steel differs for each mill. The time and cost for each mill
are shown in the following table.

\begin{tabular}{lrrrr}

\hline
  \cellcolor{gray90}\textbf{Mill}
& \cellcolor{gray90}\textbf{Cost}
& \cellcolor{gray90}\textbf{Time (min)}
& \cellcolor{gray90}\textbf{Cost}
& \cellcolor{gray90}\textbf{Time (min)}\\
\hline
Mill 1 & \$10 & 20 & \$11 & 22 \\
Mill 1 & \$12 & 24 &  \$9 & 18 \\
Mill 1 & \$14 & 28 & \$10 & 30 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Each month, Steelco must manufacture at least 500 tons of steel 1 and 600 tons
of steel 2. Formulate an LP to minimize the cost of manufacturing the desired
steel.
