In the restrictions every month Steelco must manufacture at least 500 tons of
steel 1 and 600 of 2, which states that:
$\colorij{X}{1}{1} + \colorij{X}{2}{1} + \colorij{X}{3}{1} \ge 500$ and
$\colorij{X}{1}{2} + \colorij{X}{2}{2} + \colorij{X}{3}{2} \ge 600$.
Also there is a restriction of baking time available. The oven of each mill is
available for 200 hours that in minutes would be: $200 * 60 = 12000$ minutes
per mill; and according to the data from the board about duration of steel
baking on each mill would be that in the mill 1 the steel 1 needs 20 minutes and
the steel 2, 22 minutes; in the mill 2 the steel 1 needs 24 minutes and the
steel 2 needs 18 minute; finally in the mill 3 the steel 1 needs 28 minutes and
the steel 2 30 minutes.

The last statements about time can be divided in 3 restrictions (One per mill)
as follows:
\begin{align*}
    20\colorij{X}{1}{1} + 22\colorij{X}{1}{2} &\le 12000 \\
    24\colorij{X}{2}{1} + 18\colorij{X}{2}{2} &\le 12000 \\
    28\colorij{X}{3}{1} + 30\colorij{X}{3}{2} &\le 12000 \\
      \colorij{X}{1}{1} +   \colorij{X}{2}{1} + \colorij{X}{3}{1} &\ge 500
\end{align*}
Last there is the trivial restriction that all variables must be higher or equal
to 0 for it can't be negative steel.
