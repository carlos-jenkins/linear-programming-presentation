According to LINGO the optimal cost of manufacturing the different types of
steel is \textbf{\$10400}. It must be manufactured \textbf{500} tons of steel 1
at mill 1 and \textbf{600} tons of steel 2 at mill 2. If some steel 2 is
manufactured at mill 1 it will increase costs by \$2 per ton, same happens
manufacturing steel 1 at mill 2. And finally, no (\textbf{0} tons) steel must
be manufactured at mill 3 or it will increase cost by \$4 (Steel 1) and \$1
(Steel 2) per ton.
