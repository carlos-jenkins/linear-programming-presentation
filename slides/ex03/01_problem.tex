\begin{frame}{Example 03 - Problem}
Leary Chemical manufactures three chemicals: A, B and C. These chemicals are 
produced via two production processes: 1 and 2. Running process 1 for an hour 
costs \$4 and yields 3 units of A, 1 of B, and 1 of C. Running process 2 for 
an hour costs \$1 and produces 1 unit of A and 1 of B. To meet customer demands, 
at least 10 units of A, 5 of B, and 3 of C must be produced daily. Graphically 
determine a daily production plan that minimizes the cost meeting Leary 
Chemical's daily demands.
