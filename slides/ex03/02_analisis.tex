\begin{frame}{Example 03 - Analisis}

We have to minimize the cost meeting Leary Chemical's daily demands. We know
the duration hours and the cost per hour of each process. Running process 1 for
an hour costs \$4 and running process 2 for an hour costs \$1. So we need to minimize
4*HoursUsedByProcess1 + 1*HoursUsedByProcess2.
