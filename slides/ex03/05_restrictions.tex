\begin{frame}{Example 03 - Restrictions}

The only restrictions are the minimum amounts of units of each chemicals that
must be produced. These are at least 10 units of chemical A, 5 units of chemical
B and 3 units of chemical C, this is that for A: $3\colora{x_1} + \colorb{x_2}$
must be greater or equal than $10$, for B $\colora{x_1} + \colorb{x_2}$ must be
greater or equal than 5, and for C $\colora{x_1}$ must be greater or equal than
3. Also the trivial restriction that all variables must be greater or equal than
0.
