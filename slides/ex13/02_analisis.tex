\begin{frame}{Example 13 - Analisis}
Sunco needs to maximize the profits of processing oil into aviation fuel and heating oil.
So basically it's about the sum of the price *  Product minus the cost of purchasing the oil.
that means something like 40 * Heating Oil + 90 * Heating Oil Processed + 130 * Fuel Processed
+ 60 * Fuel - 40 * Oil
