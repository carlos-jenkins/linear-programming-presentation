\begin{frame}{Example 13 - Problem (1)}
Sunco processes oil into aviation fuel and heating oil. It costs \$40 to
purchase each 1000 barrels of oil, which is then distilled and yields 500
barrels of aviation fuel and 500 barrels of heating oil. Output from the
distillation may be sold directly or processed in the catalytic cracker. If
sold after distillation without further processing, aviation fuel sells for
\$60 per 1000 barrels, and heating oil sells for \$40 per 1000 barrels.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Example 13 - Problem (2)}
It takes 1 hour to process 1000 barrels of aviation fuel in the catalytic
cracker, and these 1000 barrels can be sold or \$130. It takes 45 minutes to
process 1000 barrels of heating oil in the cracker, and these 1000 barrels can
be sold for \$90. Each day, at most 20000 barrels of oil can be purchased, and
8 hours of cracker time are available. Formulate an LP to maximize Suncoâ€™s
profits.
