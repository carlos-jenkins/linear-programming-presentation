\begin{frame}{Example 13 - Restrictions}

A maximum of 20000 barrels of oil can be bought daily, which means
$\colora{O} \le 20000$. Every thousand barrels of oil after being distilled
generate 500 barrels of airplane fuel and 500 heating oil, which means the each
constitutes a 50\% of product from the distillation, obtaining that
$\colord{F} + \colore{FP} = 0.5\colora{O}$ and
$\colorb{HO} + \colorc{HOP} = 0.5\colora{O}$. There is also a time restriction
in minutes, for it takes an hour to process the airplane fuel (60 minutes) and
45 minutes the heating oil and Sunco has 8 hours available to do this process,
that is $60\colore{FP} + 45\colorc{HOP} \le 480$. Last but not least the trivial
restrictions that all the variables must be higher or equal to 0.
