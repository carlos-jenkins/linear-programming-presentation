\begin{frame}{Example 17 - Problem (1)}
Gotham City National Bank is open Monday-Friday from 9 A.M to 5 P.M. From past
experience, the bank knows that it needs the number of tellers shown in the
following table.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cr}
\hline
  \cellcolor{gray90}\textbf{Time Period}
& \cellcolor{gray90}\textbf{Tellers Required} \\
\hline
9-10    & 4 \\
10-11   & 3 \\
11-Noon & 4 \\
Noon-1  & 6 \\
1-2     & 5 \\
2-3     & 6 \\
3-4     & 8 \\
4-5     & 8 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Example 17 - Problem (2)}
The bank hires two types of tellers. Full-time tellers work 9-5 five days a
week, except for 1 hour off for lunch. (The bank determines when a full-time
employee takes lunch hour, but each teller must go between noon and 1 P.M or
between 1 P.M and 2 P.M.). \\
\vspace{3mm}
Full-time employees are paid (including fringe
benefits) \$8 per hour (this includes payment for lunch hour). The bank may
also hire part-time tellers. Each part-time teller must work exactly 3
consecutive hours each day. \\
\vspace{3mm}
A part-time teller is paid \$5 per hour (and receives nofringe benefits). To
maintain adequate quality of service, the bank has decided that at most five
part-time tellers can be hired. Formulate an LP to meet the teller requirements
at minimum cost.
