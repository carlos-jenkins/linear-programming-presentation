\begin{frame}{Example 02 - Problem}
Truckco manufactures two types of trucks: 1 and 2. Each truck must go through 
the painting shop and assembly shop. If the painting shop were completely 
devoted to painting type 1 trucks, 800 per day could be painted, whereas if 
the painting shop were completely devoted to painting type 2 trucks, 700 per 
day could be painted. If the assembly shop were completely devoted to assembling 
truck 1 engines, 1500 per day could be assembled, and if the assembly shop were 
completely devoted to assembling truck 2 engines, 1200 per day could be 
assembled. Each type 1 truck contributes \$300 to profit; each type 2 truck 
contributes \$500. Formulate an LP that will maximize Truckco's profit.
