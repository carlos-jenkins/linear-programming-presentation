\begin{frame}{Example 09 - Restrictions}

There is a restriction about the total of wood available. A table requires 40
board ft of wood to be manufactured, a chair requires 30 board ft and there are
only 40000 board ft of wood available, that means that
$40(\colorb{FT} + \colora{UT}) + 30(\colord{FC} + \colorc{UC}) \le 40000$.
Also we could see a time restriction on the hours of skilled labor available,
there are 6000 hours available; manufacturing an unfinished table or an
unfinished chairs takes 2 hours and 3 more hours of skilled labor will turn an
unfinished table into a finished table (5 in total), and 2 more hours of skilled
labor will turn an unfinished char into a finished chair (4 in total). That
means that the sum of these hours must be less or equal than the 6000:
$5\colorb{FT} + 2\colora{UT} + 4\colord{FC} + 2\colorc{UC} \le 6000$.
