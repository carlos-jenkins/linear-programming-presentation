The solution asked is about maximize the contribution to profit from manufacturing
tables and chairs. Each unfinished table can be sold at \$70 (70*UT), each finished
table at \$140 (140*FT), an unfinished chair can be sold at \$60 (60*UC) and a finished
chair at \$110 (110*FC). But we need to deduct from these profits the cost of buying
the wood require to manufacture the chairs and tables. Each board ft of wood may be
purchased at \$1, so a table requires 40 board ft that means \$40*(FT + UT); a chair requires
30 board ft of wood so: \$30*(FC + UC). Now putting all together we have that the function
to maximize is MAX Z= 70UT + 140FT + 60UC + 110FC-40(FT+UT)-30(FC+UC).
