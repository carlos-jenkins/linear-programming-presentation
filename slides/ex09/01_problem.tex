\begin{frame}{Example 09 - Problem (1)}
Furnco manufactures tables and chairs. A table requires 40 board ft of wood,
and a chair requires 30 board ft of wood. Wood may be purchased at a cost of \$1
per board ft, and 40000 board ft of wood are available for purchase. It takes 2
hours of skilled labor to manufacture an unfinished table or an unfinished chair.
Three more hours of skilled labor will turn an unfinished table into a finished
table, and 2 more hours of skilled labor will turn an unfinished char into a
finished chair.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Example 09 - Problem (2)}
A total of 6000 hours of skilled labor are available (and have
already been paid for). All furniture produced can be sold at the following unit
prices: unfinished table, \$70; finished table, \$140; unfinished chair, \$60;
finished chair, \$110. Formulate an LP that will maximize the contribution to
profit from manufacturing tables and chairs.
