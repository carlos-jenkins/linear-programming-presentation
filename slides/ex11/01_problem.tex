\begin{frame}{Example 11 - Problem (1)}
Gandhi Clothing Company produces shirts and pants. Each shirt requires 2 sq yd
of cloth, each pair of pants, 3. During the next two months, the following
demands for shirts and pants must be met (on time): month 1-10 shirts, 15 pairs
of pants; month 2-12 shirts, 14 pairs of pants. During each month, the
following resources are available: month 1-90 sq yd of cloth; month 2 -60 sq yd.
(Cloth that is available during month 1 may, if unused during month 1, be used
during month2.)
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Example 11 - Problem (2)}
During each month, it costs \$4 to make an article of clothing with regular-time
labor and \$8 with overtime labor. During each month, a total of at most 25
articles of clothing may be produced with regular-time labor, and an unlimited
number of articles of clothing may be produced with overtime labor. At the end
of each month, a holding cost of \$3 per article of clothing is assessed.
Formulate an LP that can be used to meet demands for the next two months
(on time) at minimum cost. Assume that at the beginning of month 1, 1 shirt and
2 pairs of pants are available.
