\begin{frame}{Example 20 - Final analisis}
The optimal solution given by LINGO says that no crack oil barrels for gasoline
and for heating oil must be produce, otherwise it will decrease the profits by
\$10.58333 per barrel produced. Also it says that there are needed 3000 barrels of
Naphtha for gasoline, 3000 barrels of Naphtha for Jet Fuel, 3000 barrels of distillate
oil 1 to produce heating oil, 1000 barrels of distillate to produce. Also there might be
purchased 10000 barrels of crude 1 for distilation. If they buy crude2 the profit will
decrease by \$2.63333, same happen with barrels of distillate 1 produced for cracker,
it would decrease profit by \$6.95.
