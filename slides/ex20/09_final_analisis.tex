The optimal solution given by LINGO says that no crack oil barrels for gasoline
nor for heating oil must be produced, otherwise it will decrease the profits by
\$10.58333 per barrel produced. Also it says that there are needed \textbf{3000}
barrels of Naphtha for gasoline, \textbf{3000} barrels of Naphtha for Jet Fuel,
\textbf{3000} barrels of distillated oil 1 to produce heating oil, \textbf{1000}
barrels of distillated oil 2 to produce heating oild. Also \textbf{10000}
barrels of crude 1 for distilation must be bought. If the company buys crude 2
the profit will decrease by \$2.63333, same happens with barrels of distillate
1 produced for cracker, they would decrease profit by \$6.95.
