\begin{frame}{Example 08 - Analisis}

Coalco needs to minimize the cost of meeting customer demands.  The coal
is taking from 3 mines and it's demanded by 4 customers.  Each customer
demand a different amount of coal and shipping it to each customer has a cost
of \$8, \$10, \$11 and \$14. The coal shipped must contains at most 5\% ash
and at most 4\% sulfur.  So putting these data together with the production
cost we could express all as minimizing the sum of
(cost of shipping from a mine to each customer + Production Cost) for each
mine and customer.
