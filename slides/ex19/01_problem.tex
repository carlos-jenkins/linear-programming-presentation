The mayor of Llanview is trying to determine the number of judges needed to
handle the judicial caseload. During each month of the year it is estimated
that the number of judicial hours needed is given in the following table.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lr}
\hline
  \cellcolor{gray90}\textbf{Month}
& \cellcolor{gray90}\textbf{Hours} \\
\hline
January    & 400 \\
February   & 300 \\
March      & 200 \\
April      & 600 \\
May        & 800 \\
June       & 300 \\
July       & 200 \\
August     & 400 \\
September  & 300 \\
October    & 200 \\
November   & 100 \\
December   & 300 \\

Each judge works all 12 months, and can handle up to 120 hours per month of
casework. To avoid creating a backlog, all cases must be handled by the end of
December. Formulate an LP whose solution will determine how many judges
Llanview needs.
