\begin{frame}{Example 04 - Restrictions}

The first restriction is about the acres available in Jane's Farm. She owns 45
acres of land, so $\colora{AT} + \colorb{AM} \le 45$. Also there is restricted
the amount of workers available, there are 100 workers and for wheat production
there are needed 3 workers and for corn production there are needed 2 workers;
so these could be expressed as $3\colora{AT} + 2\colorb{AM} \le 100$.
Also wheat needs 2 tons of fertilizer, corn needs 4 tons, and there are just 120
tons of fertilizer available , so $2\colora{AT} + 4\colorb{AM} \le 120$. Then we
have the last restriction that all variables must be greater or equal than 0.
