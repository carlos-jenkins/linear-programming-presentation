\begin{itemize}
\item{January: 4 for a period of 1 month, 2 for a period of 2 months and 3 for a period of 3 months\\}
\item{February: 0 computers.\\}
\item{March: 4 for a period of 3 months.\\}
\item{April: 5 for a period of 3 months.\\}
\item{May: 1 for a period of  1 month.\\}
\item{June: 0 computers.\\}
\end{itemize}
The optimal cost is \$7100. By renting computers in february it will increase the cost in \$50, \$100, or \$50
depending of the renting period. Same happen in June and it will increase the cost in \$100, \$75 or \$50.
