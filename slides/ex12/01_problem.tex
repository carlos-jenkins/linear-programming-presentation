\begin{frame}{Example 12 - Problem (1)}
An insurance company believes that it will require the following numbers of
personal computers during the next six months: January, 9; February, 5; March,
7; April, 9; May, 10; June, 5. Computers can be rented for a period of one,
two or three months at the following unit rates: one-month rate, \$200;
two-month rate, \$350; three-month rate \$450.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Example 12 - Problem (2)}
Formulate an LP that can be used to minimize the cost of renting the required
computers. You may assume that if a machine is rented for a period of time
extending beyond June, the cost of the rental should be prorated. For example
if a computer is rented for three months at the beginning of May, then a rental
fee of (2/3)(450) = \$300, not \$450, should be assessed in the objective
function.
