\begin{frame}{Example 15 - Problem (1)}
Kiriakis Electronics produces three products. Each product must be processed on
each of three types of machines. When a machine is in use, it must be manned
by a worker. The time (in hours) required to process each product on each
machine and the profit associated with each product are shown in following
table.

\begin{frame}{Example 15 - Problem (2)}
At present, five type 1 machines, three type 2 machines, and four type 3
machines are available. The company has ten workers available and must determine
how many workers to assign to each machine. The plant is open 40 hours per week,
and each worker works 35 hours per week. Formulate an LP that will enable
Kiriakis to assign workers to machines in a way that maximizes weekly profits. \\

{\small \textbf{Note}:
a worker need not spend the entire work week manning a single machine.
