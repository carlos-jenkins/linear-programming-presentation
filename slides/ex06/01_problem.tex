\begin{frame}{Example 06 - Problem (1)}
U.S Labs manufactures mechanical heart valves from the heart valves of pigs. 
Different heart operations require valves of different sizes. U.S. Labs 
purchases pig valves from three different suppliers. The cost and size mix of 
the valves purchased from each supplier are given in the Table. Each month, U.S. 
Labs places one order with each supplier. At least 500 large, 300 medium, and 
300 small valves must be purchased each month.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Example 06 - Problem (2)}
Because of limited availability 
of pig vales, at most 500 valves per month can be purchased from each supplier. 
Formulate an LP that can be used to minimize the cost of acquiring the needed 
valves.
