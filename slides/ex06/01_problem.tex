\begin{frame}{Example 06 - Problem (1)}
U.S Labs manufactures mechanical heart valves from the heart valves of pigs.
Different heart operations require valves of different sizes. U.S. Labs
purchases pig valves from three different suppliers. The cost and size mix of
the valves purchased from each supplier are given in the following table.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lrrrr}
\hline
  \cellcolor{gray90}\textbf{Supplier}
& \cellcolor{gray90}\textbf{Cost per valve}
& \cellcolor{gray90}\textbf{\% large}
& \cellcolor{gray90}\textbf{\% medium}
& \cellcolor{gray90}\textbf{\% small} \\
\hline
Sup. 1 & \$5 & 40 & 40 & 20 \\
Sup. 2 & \$4 & 30 & 35 & 35 \\
Sup. 3 & \$3 & 20 & 20 & 60 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Example 06 - Problem (2)}
Each month, U.S. Labs places one order with each supplier. At least 500 large,
300 medium, and 300 small valves must be purchased each month.
\vspace{1cm}
Because of limited availability of pig vales, at most 500 valves per month can
be purchased from each supplier. Formulate an LP that can be used to minimize
the cost of acquiring the needed valves.
