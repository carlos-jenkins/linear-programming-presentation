\begin{frame}{Example 06 - Analisis}
U.S Labs purchases the valves from 3 different suppliers. Each of
these suppliers sells the valves at different prices. Supplier 1 sells the
valves at a cost per value of \$5, Supplier 2 sells them at \$4 and the last
one, Supplier 3 sells the valves at \$3. U.S labs needs to minimize the cost
of acquiring the needed valves, so it could be expressed as minimize
\$5*ValvesFromSupplier1 + \$4*ValvesFromSupplier2 +
\$3*ValvesFromSupplier3
