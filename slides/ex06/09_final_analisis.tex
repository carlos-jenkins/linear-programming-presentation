LINGO detects an ``Unbounded Solution" in the model. When the
``Unbounded Solution" termination occurs, it implies the formulation admits the
unrealistic result that an infinite amount of profit can be made. A more
realistic conclusion is that an important constraint has been omitted or the
formulation contains a critical typographical error.
